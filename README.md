You should run FinalWork.sln to run the program.
Database of employee data in a tech company.
In this project, I chose to simulate a data repository for a tech company that has programmers and designers. The Programmer and Designer classes are base classes, and from there additional different classes are derived. The system allows for a variety of actions such as adding employees, deleting employees, viewing the existing list of employees, calculating average age, experience, and other simple and complex functions in the field. The system works using a simple CMD interface.
